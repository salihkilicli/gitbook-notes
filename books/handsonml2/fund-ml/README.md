# I. The Fundamentals - ML

The first part of the book covers the following topics:

* What Machine Learning is, what problems it tries to solve, and the main categories and fundamental concepts of its systems
* The steps in a typical Machine Learning project
* Learning by fitting a model to data
* Optimizing a cost function
* Handling, cleaning, and preparing data
* Selecting and engineering features
* Selecting a model and tuning hyperparameters using cross-validation
* The challenges of Machine Learning, in particular, underfitting and overfitting \(the bias/variance trade-off\)
* The most common learning algorithms: Linear and Polynomial Regression, Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Ensemble methods
* Reducing the dimensionality of the training data to fight the “curse of dimensionality”
* Other unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering, density estimation, and anomaly detection
