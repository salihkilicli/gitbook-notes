# Introduction

Currently, I am working on:

* [ ] Python Basics
* [ ] the Hands-on ML2 section under the Book Notes page



* The notes consist of 4 **main** groups: 

* There are 4 types of **hints** used within the notes :

{% hint style="info" %}
**Info:** It is used to provide _tips_ and/or extra information such as a _definition_.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Warning:** It is used to present important _details_ to keep in mind.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Danger:** It is used to raise attention to common _mistakes_ and _misconceptions_.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Success:** It is used to show the _successful_ _implementation_ of a technique.
{% endhint %}
