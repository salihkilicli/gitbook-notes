# Introduction

Currently, I am working on:

* [ ] Python [Basics](tutorials/python/basics.md) under Tutorials/ Python
* [ ] The [Hands-on ML2](books/handsonml2/) book summary under Book Notes
* [x] [NLP using Spacy](tutorials/python/important-libraries/spacy.md#nlp-using-spacy) library subsection under Tutorials/Python/Important Libraries



* The notes consist of 4 **main** groups: 

* There are 4 types of **hints** used within the notes :

{% hint style="info" %}
**Info:** It is used to provide _tips_ and/or extra information such as a _definition_.
{% endhint %}

**Warning:** It is used to present important _details_ to keep in mind.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Danger:** It is used to raise attention to common _mistakes_ and _misconceptions_.
{% endhint %}
