# Git Commands & GitHub

## What is Git?

**Git** is a **distributed version-control system** for tracking changes in any set of files, originally designed for coordinating work among programmers cooperating on source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. - [Wikipedia](https://wiki2.org/en/Git)

Simply put, Git helps users for tracking different versions of the software and easily to reverting back between versions in case of unexpected results - instead of creating multiple copies of the files \(for each version\) multiple times and renaming them.

**Git** is the distributed version-control system whereas **GitHub** is a repository hosting service. You need to install Git to use on your computer and it doesn't require internet connection unlike GitHub in which you own / share repositories on the web to work on your projects.
